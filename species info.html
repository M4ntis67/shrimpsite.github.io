                <h2>Information About <em>Neocaridina</em></h2>
                    <h3>Basic Info</h3>
                    <p><em>Neocaridina</em>, more commonly known as <strong>Red Cherry Shrimp</strong>, are a freshwater shrimp species native to Taiwan. They're omnivores- favored for their taste for biofilm(the annoying bacteria and algae that dirty our tank glass)- and are usually added to tanks as cleaners.</p>
                    <p>Even though they may not pose as much a challenge as fish care-wise, you should still put a lot of effort into taking care of your new aquarium residents. Whether it be a species-only collection or a community tank, this is a page you should look at to get to know these little crustaceans.</p>
                    <h3>Sexual Dimorphism</h3>
                        <img src="genders.jpg" alt="Male and Female Neos."/>
                <p>When a shrimp is at mating age, you can easily tell what its sex is.</p>
                <p>Female shrimp are usually much larger than males at maturity, and their bellies are plump and rounded to make carrying their eggs easier. When a female is ready to mate, a yellow 'saddle' will appear on or behind the shrimp's head. These are her premature eggs, and they'll be carried under her body after she mates.</p>

                <h4><strong>Fun Fact: A female shrimp who is carrying eggs is "berried."</strong></h4>
                
                <p>Male shrimp are much smaller than their female counterparts. They're slimmer, as they don't have to carry eggs, and are usually not as colorful as females.</p>
                
                <img src="27RCS775800WS.webp" alt="A male cherry shrimp."/>
                
                <p>Because of this, it's very hard to tell the grade of male shrimp at a glance. <br><strong>Grades</strong> of shrimp are categories organized by how full their colorization is. The richer the color, the higher grade and value of the individual. Generally, marketers who know their shrimp will sell high-grade breed-viable shrimp at higher prices than those at lower grades.</p>
                
                <img src="Untitled.png" alt="A chart showing how color affects grade in shrimp."/>
                
                <p>However, male shrimp may be exempt to this rule. Their drab looks aren't always a clear window into the grades they'll <strong>throw</strong>(in non-shrimp vocab, the grades of their children), and many males who seem like they're low-grade breeders have the genes for higher grade offspring.</p>

                <h3>Water Parameters</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>pH/Water hardness: 6.8 to 7.2</li>
                <li>gH/General hardness: 8 to 12</li>
                <li>Temperature: 70 to 80 degrees fahrenheit, 21 to 26 celsius</li>
                <li>Nitrates: < 20ppm</li>
                <li>Ammonia and Nitrites: 0 ppm</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are my recommended water parameters for keeping RCS. The pH and gH are pretty standard- shrimp are very, <em>very</em> sensitive to change, so take acclimating very slow- changing hardness once every week.</p>
