                <h2>Information About <em>Neocaridina</em></h2>
                    <h3>Basic Info</h3>
                    <p><em>Neocaridina</em>, more commonly known as <strong>Red Cherry Shrimp</strong>, are a freshwater shrimp species native to Taiwan. They're omnivores- favored for their taste for biofilm(the annoying bacteria and algae that dirty our tank glass)- and are usually added to tanks as cleaners.</p>
                    <p>Even though they may not pose as much a challenge as fish care-wise, you should still put a lot of effort into taking care of your new aquarium residents. Whether it be a species-only collection or a community tank, this is a page you should look at to get to know these little inch-long crustaceans.</p>
                    <h3>Sexual Dimorphism</h3>
                        <img src="genders.jpg" alt="Male and Female Neos."/>
                <p>When a shrimp is at mating age, you can easily tell what its sex is(young shrimp all look like males until the females have their first eggs).</p>
                <p>Female shrimp are usually much larger than males at maturity, and their bellies are plump and rounded to make carrying their eggs easier. When a female is ready to mate, a yellow 'saddle' will appear on or behind the shrimp's head. These are her premature eggs, and they'll be carried under her body after she mates.</p>

                <h4><strong>Fun Fact: A female shrimp who is carrying eggs is "berried."</strong></h4>
                
                <p>Male shrimp are much smaller than their female counterparts. They're slimmer, as they don't have to carry eggs, and are usually not as colorful as females.</p>
                
                <img src="27RCS775800WS.webp" alt="A male cherry shrimp."/>
                
                <p>Because of this, it's very hard to tell the grade of male shrimp at a glance. <br><strong>Grades</strong> of shrimp are categories organized by how full their colorization is. The richer the color, the higher grade and value of the individual. Generally, marketers who know their shrimp will sell high-grade breed-viable shrimp at higher prices than those at lower grades.</p>
                
                <img src="Untitled.png" alt="A chart showing how color affects grade in shrimp."/>
                
                <p>However, male shrimp may be exempt to this rule. Their drab looks aren't always a clear window into the grades they'll <strong>throw</strong>(in non-shrimp vocab, the grades of their children), and many males who seem like they're low-grade breeders have the genes for higher grade offspring.</p>

            <div class="waterParameters">
                <h3>Water Parameters</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>pH/Water hardness: 6.8 to 7.2</li>
                <li>gH/General hardness: 4 to 12. What really matters is preference; the lower your gH, the softer your shrimp's shells will be. If you want to keep them with fish, a higher gH will help your shrimp feel secure. If you keep them by themselves(species-only tank), gH anywhere in that range is okay as long as you acclimate them <em>VERY</em> slowly(see below).</li>
                <li>Temperature: 70 to 80 degrees fahrenheit, 21 to 26 celsius</li>
                <li>Nitrates: less than 20ppm </li>
                <li>Ammonia and Nitrites: 0 ppm</li>
                <li>Substrate. Always have substrate of some kind for a shrimp tank- it captures food particles like a rug, helping the shrimp a great deal. Sand or gravel are nice options.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are my recommended water parameters for keeping RCS. The pH and gH are pretty standard- shrimp are very, <em>very</em> sensitive to change, so take acclimating very slow- changing hardness once every week.</p>
                <p>I'd also recommend having your tank be heavily planted. All freshwater shrimp love to hide in the shelter of plants like java moss, and yummy biofilm grows on plants too. Shrimp have a diet composed mosty of biofilm, and if you have a densely planted tank, you don't have to feed the shrimp as often. Shrimplets also can compete less for food because there's more of it, which leads to generations of happy and healthy shrimp.</p>

        <div class="offspring">
        <h3>Offspring</h3>
        <p>If your tank has the right conditions, your shrimp will start breeding. And when I say breeding, I mean breeding like <em>crazy</em>. Your tank can go very quickly from six to one thousand in twelve months if conditions are right. With so many babies so soon, you'll have to know how to care for them.</p>
        <p>When your berried female first loses her eggs, don't expect to see shrimplets immediately. They're transparent and about 2mm long when they're born, and they usually hide for a while in vegetation(if your tank is planted) until they're bigger. They also come out when your tank lights turn off, so when they turn back on, you might catch a glimpse of them darting back into hiding.</p>
        <p>After about 3 days, your shrimplets will start getting their first shades of coloration. You might see some of them come out of hiding- maybe four or five, but if you flip over a piece of driftwood or part a cluster of plants, you might find an additional twenty or thirty. They'll feed mostly on biofilm and the molted shells of adults(this is how they get calcium to grow their own shells. having a good concentration of calcium in the water column is also good). After about 35-40 days, they'll be mature and be able to breed.</p>
