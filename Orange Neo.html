            <p>One of my personal favorites. My shrimp colony started with one spunky little female named Apricot, and a red neo named Cherry. Cherry didn't survive, but Apricot did, and my entire tank is made mostly up of her descendants. I love the color on these guys, but they're a hard find in stores. Widely avaliable online.</p>
            <h2>About this Variant</h2>
            <p>Orange Neocaridina are bred from... uh... a couple different strains(all of which originate from your classic red cherry). It can be hard at first to pick from all the different shades, but you should probably go for the hardy solidly-colored ones instead of rilis(who are always more expensive</p>
            <h2>Breeding with this Variant</h2>
            <p>I've mixed a brighter and darker strain in my tank, and my oranges range in shade and intensity. I've got one female named Meyer who has some red from hybridization, and another named Harry who is orange with a yellow belly. I've also accidentally gotten a pair of high-grade rilis without even having adult rilis in the first place. That's what I call luck.</p>
            
            <p>Here's a list of breeding results you can get from orange neos:*</p>
        <h3>Common</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Orange Shrimp(in general)</li>
            <li>Red Cherry Shrimp(if hybridizing)</li>
            <li>Red Sakura Shrimp(if hybridizing)</li>
            <li>Wild Cherry Shrimp(if mixing colors)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Uncommon</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Orange Rilis(i got twins!)</li>
            <li>Red Rilis(if hybridizing, i got several)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Rare</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Red-and-Orange mix(mostly orange with a bit of a red tinge. i have no idea how this happened, but the combination was an orange neo female with a male who i bought as an 'Orange Sakura', but under light he was a lot more yellowish.</li>
            <li>Goldenback Gene(again, it's inherited, so it's hard to find in stores to add to the gene pool unless they specifically breed for it)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*this will depend entirely on the grade of your original breeding adults- I created this chart assuming that the breeders are mid-grade sakura.</p>
