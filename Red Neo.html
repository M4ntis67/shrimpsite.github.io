        <p>One of the most popular variants of RCS in the hobby. Any store or site that sells shrimp will have these for sale, and they also tend to be the cheapest variant. They're great for someone who's never purchased freshwater shrimp before, as they are(usually) inexpensive.</p>
            
        <h2>About this Variant</h2>
            
        <p>Red Neos are popular for their color, and also their ease of keeping. These shrimp are one of the hardier variants, so starting with reds is a good place for a rookie shrimper.</p>
            
        <h2>Breeding with this Variant</h2>
        
        <p>If you buy red neos, it's best to seperate them from other variants(ie: a red-only tank), as combining colors almost always results in low-grade red sakuras wherever you look. That said, I do keep reds with my oranges and blues- my tank is ending up mostly red, but sometimes I get orange shrimplets with reddish tints. Which is pretty darn cool.</p>
        
        <p>Here's a list of breeding results you can get from red neos:*</p>
            
        <h3>Common</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Cherry</li>
            <li>Low-Grade Sakura Reds</li>
            <li>Medium-Grade Sakura Reds</li>
            <li>High-Grade Sakura Reds</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Uncommon</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Low-Grade Rilis(I got 1 rili out of a litter of 7, the rest being ranging sakura)</li>
            <li>Medium-Grade Rilis(in the next generation, I got three of these in a really large litter of cherry-grade and sakura-grade)</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h3>Rare</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Blue Neos(alright, hear me out; these guys were bred from the red strain, so it's entirely possible to get them after a while or by accident.)</li>
            <li>"Goldenback" Trait(this results in females who have a bright stripe on their back- after it appears, it'll be inherited. in reds, this is usually pinkish or white.)</li>
            <li>High-Grade Rilis</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>*this will depend entirely on the grade of your original breeding adults- I created this chart assuming that the breeders are mid-grade sakura.</p>
