            <h2>About this site</h2>
            <p>Caring for freshwater shrimp species for the first time might seem like a daunting feat at first. <br> This is why I made this website. I myself am caring for a tank of my own, and this site will be filled with information from my experiences. <br>Although this website might not have information that's completely helpful or accurate, I hope it helps you in some way.</p>
                <p>Even though it might be challenging to start, eventually- if you get things right- your tank will be a booming paradise of active, healthy, breeding shrimp.</p>
